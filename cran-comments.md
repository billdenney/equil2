* This is a new release.
* It is the first time that the code for this scientific method for determining
  kidney stone risk has been publicly released.  The original publication was in
  1985 and the original authors have passed away.  I received the code with
  permission to reproduce and release open source from one of the world experts
  in kidney stones at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, Dr. John Lieske.
  The method is still in common use in current publications, internationally.
* The caveat in the DESCRIPTION file of "This program is intended for research
  use, only." was required by Dr. Lieske to allow for its release.
* Updated DESCRIPTION based on CRAN review.
